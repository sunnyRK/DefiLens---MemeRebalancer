# DefiLens Memecoins Rebalancer | Base-India Hackathon

With our project on Base-India Devfolio Hackathon, we're tackling some key challenges for memecoin investors:

- Making it simpler to buy different memecoins on Base. Right now, it's tricky for people to invest in multiple coins easily.
- Cutting down on gas fees. We're using Base to help users trade without paying extra, which is great for smaller investors.
- Keeping users in the know. We're providing easy access to market info and trends about Base memecoins to help people make smarter choices.
- Simplifying the investment process. Our goal is to help folks manage their Base memecoin portfolios without needing to be tech wizards.
- Giving more control to users. We're working on ways for people to easily adjust their investments based on what's happening in the Base memecoin market.

By building on Base, we're aiming to make memecoin investing on this chain easier, cheaper, and more user-friendly for everyone in our community.
